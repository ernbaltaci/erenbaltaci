description: 'Scaling seller growth stack: onboarding, KYC, payout rails, and analytics.'
details: |
  ### Why it matters

  Sellibra onboards thousands of marketplace sellers each quarter. I own the
  internal developer platform that keeps the onboarding, KYC, payout, and
  insights stack glued together without blocking product teams.

  ### What I shipped

  - API-first workflow library so ops can compose new seller journeys.
  - Consent + KYC engine that hashes docs and auto routes to compliance.
  - Live health dashboards for payout pipes, backed by ClickHouse + Tinybird.

  ### Impact so far

  - 38% faster seller activation (time-to-first-sale)
  - Compliance review SLA dropped from days to hours
  - Zero on-call pages in the last 6 months thanks to stronger guardrails
