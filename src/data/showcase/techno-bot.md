Techno Bot is a Discord bot focused on word and voice-based party games. It currently serves **40,000+ servers** and **3 million players**, giving communities a shared space for trivia, word ladders, and voice-activated challenges.

### Why it matters
Starting the project at age 12 forced me to learn software engineering and community management in public. Scaling the bot taught me how to:

- Communicate roadmap changes to thousands of server owners.
- Plan monetization and premium features without breaking trust.
- Keep moderation, logging, and uptime stable while usage spikes.

### Stack
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Node.js, TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, NestJS, Express.js  
- **Data:** MongoDB  
- **APIs:** REST  
- **Infra:** Docker Compose + PM2 for process management

### Impact
- Built a multi-tenant, event-driven command system that handles millions of invocations per day.
- Shipped a live dashboard so server admins can customize commands and track engagement.
- Evolved the architecture from a single process bot to a containerized, horizontally scalable service.

Techno Bot remains my longest-running product and continues to be the playground where I experiment with new game mechanics, observability tooling, and developer experience workflows.
