## Techno Bot — Discord Games Bot *(Discontinued / Legacy Project)*

Techno Bot was a Discord bot focused on word- and voice-based games.  
At its peak, it served **30,000+ servers** and **millions of players**, giving communities a shared space for trivia, word ladders, and voice-activated challenges.

### Why it mattered
Starting the project at age **12** forced me to learn software engineering and community management in public.  
Scaling the bot taught me how to:

- Communicate roadmap and breaking changes to thousands of server owners.
- Design monetization and premium features without breaking user trust.
- Keep moderation, logging, and uptime stable during traffic spikes.

### Stack
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Node.js, Next.js, TypeScript, **tsoa (OpenAPI-first API design)**
- **Data:** MongoDB, Prisma
- **Infra:** Docker

### Impact
- Built a multi-tenant, event-driven command system handling **millions of invocations per day** at peak.
- Shipped a live admin dashboard for server owners to customize commands and track engagement.
- Evolved the architecture from a single-process bot to a containerized, horizontally scalable service.

### Project Status
Techno Bot has been **intentionally discontinued**.  
The project was shut down after reaching product maturity, as usage declined and my focus shifted to new technical challenges.  
It remains a defining early project that shaped my approach to scalable systems, developer experience, and long-term product ownership.
