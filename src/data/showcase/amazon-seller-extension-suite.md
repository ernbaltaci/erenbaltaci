I worked as a full-stack developer in a fast-paced startup environment at Sellibra, turning Figma concepts into production features within days.

### What I built
- **Responsive control panels** in Next.js + Tailwind that mirrored Figma specs and shipped within each sprint.
- **Chrome Extensions** hundreds of Amazon sellers rely on to analyze products and competitors directly inside Amazon.
- **GraphQL + NestJS integrations** so the extension and dashboard stayed in sync with Sellibra’s APIs.

### How it helped
- Enabled product to iterate on seller insights without blocking on backend changes.
- Reduced maintenance overhead by refactoring legacy UI flows into composable components.
- Kept the team aligned through sprint rituals (planning, stand-ups, retros) across Jira, Confluence, and Slack.

This suite became the fastest feedback loop Sellibra had: ideas surfaced in design, prototypes landed in production extensions days later.
