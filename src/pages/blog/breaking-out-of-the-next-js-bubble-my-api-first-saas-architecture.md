# Exploring Beyond Next.js: Building a Modern SaaS Stack with SvelteKit, Express, and TSOA

For many developers, starting a new full-stack project means defaulting to **Next.js**.  
It’s a fantastic tool fast, flexible, and backed by a strong ecosystem.  
But it’s important to remember that **there are other powerful frameworks** out there worth exploring.

---

## 🚀 Why I Built the SaaS Starter Kit

I wanted to create a foundation for modern SaaS applications — something **lightweight**, **API-first**, and **type-safe** from end to end.  
That’s how the **SaaS Starter Kit** was born.

It’s a full-stack boilerplate designed especially for **solo developers and small teams** who want to move fast without giving up structure or best practices.

---

## 🧩 The Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit 5  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TSOA  

The most powerful feature of this setup is its **API-first workflow**.  
Instead of manually writing API clients or keeping type definitions in sync, the backend defines everything once — in **TypeScript**.

From that, **TSOA** automatically generates an **OpenAPI specification**.  
The frontend can then consume that spec to generate a **fully type-safe client**, ensuring that both sides stay aligned at all times.

---

## ⚙️ The Benefits of an API-First Workflow

- **Full type safety** between client and server  
- **No duplicated models or interfaces**  
- **Automatic synchronization** when endpoints change  
- **Fewer bugs**, faster development  

This not only speeds up development but also **eliminates an entire class of integration errors** that typically occur when frontend and backend evolve separately.

## 🧱 Built for Modern SaaS Development

Whether you’re launching your first product or experimenting with a new stack, this starter kit gives you a solid, production-ready foundation.

If you’re used to working with Next.js, you’ll find this architecture refreshingly minimal, fast, and highly maintainable.  
It’s proof that **SvelteKit can compete at the highest level** of full-stack web development.
